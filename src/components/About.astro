          The Life Centered Design Collective is a small group of designers and
          educators with varying backgrounds. Our goal is to bring together
          people, skills and knowledge that advance the practice and advocate
          for the philosophy of life-centered design.
          <br />
          <br />
          We imagine a world where all life and long-term effects are top of mind
          while creating products, services and systems.
          <br />

          <Text as="p" className="text-white-light">
            The Life Centered Design Collective is a small group of designers
            and educators with varying backgrounds. Our goal is to bring
            together people, skills and knowledge that advance the practice and
            advocate for the philosophy of life-centered design.
            <br />
            <br />
            We imagine a world where all life and long-term effects are top of mind
            while creating products, services and systems.

              exploration, continually expanding our knowledge and expertise. We
              come together regularly to share experiences and insights,
              fostering a rich environment of collaborative learning.</Text

              serve as both practical applications and educational tools,
              allowing us to disseminate our findings and inspire others in the
              design community.</Text

      <Text as="p" className="text-white-light">
        At the core of Life-centered Design is the belief that design should be
        holistic, inclusive, and sustainable. We strive to create solutions that
        are not only innovative but also mindful of the interconnectedness of
        life. By focusing on the bigger picture, we aim to address complex
        challenges in ways that promote harmony between human needs and the
        natural world.
